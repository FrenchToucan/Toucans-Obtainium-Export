This repo contains my ever-evolving Obtainium export.


#### Steps

Manual Method
1. Download and extract source code from most recent release.
2. Open Obtainium.
3. Go to **Import/Export** (at the bottom).
4. Select **Obtainium Import**.
5. Choose the `obtainium-export.json` file.
6. (Recommended) Go to **Settings** and add your GitHub Personal Access Token in the **Source-Specific** section. Otherwise you'll be rate limited pretty much immediately.
7. (Recommended) After installing and enabling Shizuku, go to **Settings** and select **Use Shiuku or Sui to install**.

Semi-automatic Method
1. **Connect your Android device** (with USB debugging enabled).
2. **Save the script** above as `install_obtainium_and_import.sh`.
3. In your terminal, run:
   ```bash
   chmod +x install_obtainium_and_import.sh
   ./install_obtainium_and_import.sh
   ```
4. **On your device**, open Obtainium, go to its import feature, and select `obtainium_export.json` from your Downloads folder.
